### What did they do and how did they confirm?<br>
 - Comparison with shallower and deeper saliency prediction models that are end-to-end trained.
 - Showing the validity of using pretrained models on classificationtasks to saliency prediction.

### What is new? (or what is previous issue)<br>
 - Compared with the previous studies that used hand-crafted features, CNN-based saliency

### Interesting techniques, ideas and methods<br>
     

### Interesting hypothesis and analysis<br>
  - Classification network pretrained would be also useful for saliency prediction.
  - Shallower network focus on the cntre of images.
  - Deeper model have a higher spatial resolution, compared with shallower one.

### What would I want to know furthermore?<br>

#### Dataset<br>
  - SALICON
  - iSUN: dataset based on online game7s eye-tracking
  - MIT1003 and MIT300
 
#### Initialization<br>

#### Ebaluation method<br>
 - AUC
  - Shuffled, Borji, Judd
