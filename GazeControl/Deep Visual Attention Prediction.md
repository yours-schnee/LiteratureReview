### What did they do and how did they confirm?<br>


### What is new? (or what is previous issue)<br>
 - Multi-level saliency prediction by a signle netwok, which has an encoder-decoder architecture.

### Interesting techniques, ideas and methods<br>


### Interesting hypothesis and analysis<br>


### Waht is the limitation I think?<br>


### What would I want to know furthermore?<br>
